    Simpleblog is a fairly generic blog website that serves as plain
    demonstration rather than a legitimate source of information. It was made by
    Mateusz Åšcianek as a project for a "Introduction to Web Development" college
    course. All the text content provided on the site as well as the images were
    generated using dedicated AI technologies. The app itself was created using
    <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank">Svelte</a>,
    <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a> and
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>.<br /><br
    />
    The app is publicly accessible on
    <a href="http://simpleblog-scianek.vercel.app"
      >simpleblog-scianek.vercel.app</a
